					<h2>Advantages of SQL</h2>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Data Accuracy</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Normalization</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">High Security</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Data Accuracy: In the relational database system, there can be multiple tables related to one another with the use of a primary key and foreign key concepts. This makes the data to be non-repetitive. There is no chance for duplication of data.

						Normalization: The methodical style is maintained for making sure of a relational database structure is liberated of any variances that can make a difference in the integrity and accuracy of the tables in the database. 

						High Security: As the data is divided amongst the tables of the relational database system, it is possible to make a few tables to be tagged as confidential and others not.

					<h2>NoSQL database</h2>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Stands for "not only SQL"</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">non-relational data management system</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						NoSQL is Stands for "not only SQL". NoSQL Database is a non-relational data management system, that
						does not require a fixed schema. It avoids joins, and is easy to scale. The major purpose of using a
						NoSQL database is for distributed data stores with humongous data storage needs.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Advantages of NoSQL</h2>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Elastic scalability</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Big data applications</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Database administration</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">Economy</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Elastic scalability: NoSQL databases are made for transparent expansion, taking advantage of new nodes. These databases are designed for use with low-cost commodity hardware.
						
						Big data applications: With SQL handling Big data is very costly as you will have to increase the hardware for scaling.
						NoSQL makes it easy to store all different types of data together and without having to invest time into defining what type of data you’re storing in advance.

						Database administration:  NoSQL databases require much less hands-on management than relation database with data distribution and auto repair capabilities, simplified data models and fewer tuning and administration requirements.

						Economy: NoSQL databases can be easily installed in cheap commodity hardware clusters as transaction and data volumes increase. This means that you can process and store more data at much less cost.

				<p>MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage.</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables.

			<h3>MongoDB example</h3>
			<pre><code>{
	_id: ObjectId(3da252d3902a),
	type: "Presintation",
	title: "MongoDB",
	author: "Borisov A",
	tags: [ "mongodb", "compass", "crud" ],

		 name: "javascript",
		 description: "Presintation"
	  },
	],
	content: "MongoDB is a cross-platform..."
 }
			</code></pre>
			<aside class="notes">
				As you can see, the document has a number of fields(type , title ), which store values(Presintation). These values can contain strings, numbers, arrays, arrays of sub-documents (for example, the categories field), geo-coordinates and more.
				The _id field name is reserved for use as a primary key. Its value must be unique in the collection, it’s immutable, and it may be of any type other than an array.

			<h2>MongoDB CRUD</h2>
			<aside class="notes">
				As you might already know, the CRUD acronym stands for create, read, update, and delete. These are the four basic database operations that you can’t avoid while building an application. 
			</aside>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Create Operation</h3>
			<p><pre><code>db.COLLECTION_NAME.insertOne({"key":"value"})</code></pre></p>
			<p><pre><code>db.COLLECTION_NAME.insertMany([&lt;document 1&gt;,&lt;document 2&gt;, ... ])</code></pre></p>
			<aside class="notes">
				Creation is the same as inserting a document into a collection.
				To insert a document, you can use db.COLLECTION_NAME.insertOne for 1 doc or insertMany for many doc 
			</aside>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Example</h3>
			<p><pre><code>&gt; db.users.insertOne({name: "Bob"})
{
	"acknowledged" : true,
	"insertedId" : ObjectId("5a52c53b223039ee9c2daaec")
}</code></pre></p>
			<aside class="notes">
				MongoDB automatically creates a new users collection and inserts a document with the key–value pair 'name':'Bob'. The ObjectId returned is the ID of the document inserted. MongoDB creates a unique ObjectId for each document on creation, and it becomes the default value of the _id field.
			</aside>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3 >Read Operation</h3>
			<p ><pre><code>db.collection.find(query, projection)</code></pre></p>
			<p ><pre><code>db.collection.findOne(query, projection)</code></pre></p>
			<aside class="notes">
				A read operation is used to retrieve a document, or multiple documents from a collection.
				db.collection.find(query, projection)
			</aside>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Example</h3>
			<p><pre><code>&gt; db.users.find().pretty()
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("5e25bb58ba0cf16476aa56ff"),
	"name" : "Tom",
	"age" : 15,
	"email" : "tom@example.com"
}</code></pre></p>
			<aside class="notes">
				To retrieve all user documents, you can do db.users.find().pretty() The pretty method is a cursor method
			</aside>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3 >Update Operation</h3>
			<p><pre><code>db.collection.updateOne(&lt;filter&gt;, &ltupdate&gt;, &lt;options&gt;)</code></pre></p>
			<p><pre><code>db.collection.updateMany(&lt;filter&gt;, &ltupdate&gt;, &lt;options&gt;)</code></pre></p>
			<aside class="notes">
				An update operation modifies documents in a collection. Similar to the create operation, MongoDB offers various methods for updating a document. For example:
			</aside>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Example</h3>
			<p><pre><code>&gt; db.users.updateMany({}, {$set: { registration: "incomplete"}})
{ "acknowledged" : true, 
	"matchedCount" : 4, 
	"modifiedCount" : 4
}
</code></pre></p>
			<aside class="notes">
				The first argument is an empty object because we want to update all documents in the collection. The $set is an update operator that sets the value of a field with the specified value. You can verify that the extra field was added using db.users.find()
			</aside>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3 >Delete Operation</h3>
			<p><pre><code>db.collection.deleteOne(&lt;filter&gt;,&lt;options&gt;)</code></pre></p>
			<p><pre><code>db.collection.deleteMany(&lt;filter&gt;,&lt;options&gt;)</code></pre></p>
			<aside class="notes">
				A delete operation removes a document from the collection. To delete a document, you can use the deleteOne method, and to delete multiple documents, you can use the deleteMany method.
			</aside>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Example</h3>
			<p><pre><code>&gt; db.users.updateOne(
{email: "tom@example.com" },
{$set: { status: "dormant"}
})
{ "acknowledged" : true, 
  "matchedCount" : 1,
  "modifiedCount" : 1
}
&gt;db.users.deleteMany({status:{$in: [ "dormant", "inactive" ]}})
{ "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 1 }
</code></pre></p>
			<aside class="notes">
				To delete documents based on certain criteria, you can use the filter operators 
				This deletes all documents with a status of “dormant” or “inactive”
